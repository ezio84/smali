if building like this:
https://github.com/JesusFreke/smali/wiki
the final jar won't have the correct manifest (with the main class index and other needed stuff).

To correctly build, open the cloned repo in Android Studio, then tap on the top right Gradle button,
then for both :smali and :backsmali entries expand Tasks>other and double tap on "fatJar"
Then grab the final "fat" jars from smali/build/libs and backsmali/build/libs
and put them into Superr kitchen or wherever you need them
